## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

This is a statistical study to determine if we predict values for maintenance cost using a linear model and values from cost. Analyzing the relationship of cost and maintenance cost would support the decision of choosing the best ratio. This would quantify how the vehicle performs against the competition by providing potential profit margins for the company.

The metrics to test are city and highway fuel efficiencies.

Null Hypothesis (Ho): MechaCar is priced correctly based on its performance of key factors for its genre.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): MechaCar is NOT priced correctly based on performance of key factors for its genre.

A multiple linear regression would be used to determine the factors that have the highest correlation/predictability with the list selling price (dependent variable); which combination has the greatest impact on price.

The data needed to perform this study would be the cost and maintenance cost of MechaCar prototypes.
